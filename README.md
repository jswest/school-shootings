# School Shootings Map Generator

_The Washington Post_ has [compiled a list](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings) of school shooting in the United States since 1999. I wanted to create a way to produce a server-side, GIF map of these data. This software will do that.

## Installation

* Run `npm install`.
* Download [the data](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings/blob/master/school-shootings-data.csv) as `shootings.csv`.

## Running it

* Run `node main.js`.

## Working with it
